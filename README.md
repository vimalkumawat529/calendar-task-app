# **Task Scheduler with Drag and Drop Functionality**

## **Description**

This is a simple web application that allows users to drag tasks from a task list and drop them onto a specific date in a calendar. The task will then be displayed on the selected date. This functionality is implemented using ReactJS and React-DnD for drag-and-drop capabilities. The app is designed to work locally without any backend calls.

## **Features**

- Display a calendar with selectable dates.
- Show a task list beside the calendar.
- Enable drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to drag a task and drop it on a specific date in the calendar.
- Once dropped, display the task on that date in the calendar.
- Entire interaction is handled locally (no backend required).
